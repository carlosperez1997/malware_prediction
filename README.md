# Microsoft Malware Prediction
Repository developed to solve a Binary Classification problem that deals with malware in Microsoft Computers. The goal is to develop a classification model able to predict if a machine has malware or not. 

The dataset is extracted from a Kaggle Competition, even though for academic purposes the dataset has been reduced and preprocessed. The final model has a ROC AUC score of 0.719, you can see the code of the model in [[model]].
